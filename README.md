OBFS Widget Code (JS)
====

The Organization for Biological Field Stations contracts with a 3-rd party vendor for hosting and membership management. That company (memberclicks.com) doesn't have a very nice way of displaying calendar items. 

This is a bit of code I modified to run the Field Course Side Widget for the interior pages of the website. It strips all the BS formatting out and just shows course title and date.
Example: http://www.obfs.org/news Upcoming Field Courses widget

Needed:
On the front page, there is also a course widget, but I haven't been able to use the JavaScript there.
That's because alllllll the code in memberclicks is loaded on every page.

When I try to use JS on the front page, I keep ending up with multiple entries, and haven't had time to sort that out. I've stuck the original code and my short side widget version here for now.
