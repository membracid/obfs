OBFS Widget Code (JS)
====

The Organization for Biological Field Stations contracts with a 3-rd party vendor for hosting and membership management. That company (memberclicks.com) doesn't have a very nice way of displaying calendar items. 

This is a bit of code I modified to run the Field Course Side Widget for the interior pages of the website. It strips all the BS formatting out and just shows Course title and date.
Example: http://www.obfs.org/news


Needed:  
I have tried to modify this to work on the front page widget, but because alllllll the code in memberclicks is loaded on every page, I keep ending up with multiple entries, and haven't had time to sort that out.
